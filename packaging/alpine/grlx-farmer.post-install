*  grlx-farmer expects /srv/grlx/recipes/prod to exist.
*  This directory is not automatically created.
*
*  This can be corrected with the following commands:
*    mkdir -p /srv/grlx/recipes/prod
*    chown -R farmer:farmer /srv/grlx
*
*  Additionally, /etc/grlx/pki/farmer needs to be configured before
*  the server can be run.
