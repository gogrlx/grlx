## Reporting a Vulnerability

Contact security@grlx.org with any relevant info including:

 - criticality
 - a summary
 - any reproduction information
 - whether or not you desire attribution
 - patches (if you have them)

Turnaround time should be within a matter of hours, at most 72 for confirmation.

If your vulnerability is accepted, we will release a new hotfix and notify users.
We will explain the vulnerability to the community after a reasonable amount of
time has elapsed, allowing users the chance to update, and you will be credited at
this time, if you desire.
